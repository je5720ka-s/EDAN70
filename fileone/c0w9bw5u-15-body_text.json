Viral RNA accumulation of six ORFs decreased rapidly in PAA-treated cells at both the early and late stages of infection ( Figure 5C ). Only SCH07072 cells showed a 3D8 scFv Confers Resistance to DNA Virus Infection PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org substantial reduction in viral RNA accumulation during the entire infection cycle under the PAA-untreated condition compared to HeLa and muSCH cells. The expression of ICP0 and ICP4 in SCH07072 cells cultured with PAA decreased by 72.5% and 74.9%, respectively, compared to HeLa cells during the immediate early stage. At the late infection stage, SCH07072 cells expressed 83.1% and 87% less UL19 and UL 38 transcripts, respectively, than those of HeLa cells after virus challenge ( Figure 5C ). However, ICP0 and ICP4 levels were 69.4% and 60.7% lower than in HeLa cells during the immediate early stage of muSCH cell infection, and were similar to the viral RNA content seen in SCH07072 cells. However, at the late stage of infection, the viral RNA accumulation patterns in muSCH cells were similar to those in HeLa cells ( Figure 5C ).", "denotations": []}

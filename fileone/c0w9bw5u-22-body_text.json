The concentration of each protein was adjusted to be 1.5625610 23 [19] . However, when we introduced the same unit amounts of DNase I and 3D8 scFv into HeLa cells using a microporator, the antiviral effects of the 3D8 scFv protein were almost 8-fold higher than those of DNase I ( Figure S2C ). This result indicates that 3D8 scFv has a greater antiviral effect than DNase I, most likely due to the additional RNase activity of 3D8 scFv ( Figure S2 ).", "denotations": []}
